## My process

### Built with

- media query
- Flexbox
- CSS variables

### What I learned


I learnt how to cross a word using the html del tag
```html
  <p>this is a <del>crossed</del> word</p>
```
I dicovered a new font: Fraunces, serif

I also know that exist a way to use multiple images in the same img tag to display each one depending on the screen size but I didn't figure it out so I'll check that later



### Continued development

I'll focus more on images, they are kinda tricky when sizing them.
